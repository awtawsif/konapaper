# Konapaper Configuration File
# ==============================================================================
# This file allows you to set default values for the konapaper.sh script.
# The script searches for this file in the following order:
# 1. The user's config directory (`~/.config/konapaper/konapaper.conf`)
# 2. The directory where the script itself is located.
# 3. The directory where the script is executed (`./konapaper.conf`)
#
# Any command-line arguments you provide will override the settings in this file.
# To enable an option, uncomment it by removing the '#' at the beginning of the line.

# TAGS: A space-separated list of tags to search for.
# Example: TAGS="touhou scenic"
# Default: "" (empty)

# LIMIT: The number of posts to retrieve from the API for each query.
# A higher number gives you a larger pool to select a random image from,
# but may slow down the initial query.
# Default: 50
# LIMIT=100

# RATING: Filter posts by rating.
# Available options:
#   "s" - Safe
#   "q" - Questionable
#   "e" - Explicit

# ORDER: How to sort the posts retrieved from the API.
# Available options:
#   "random" - A random selection of posts. (Recommended for variety)
#   "score"  - Sort by the post's score, highest first.
#   "date"   - Sort by the post's creation date, newest first.
# Default: "random"
# ORDER="random"

# PAGE: The page number to query from the API.
# Can be a number (e.g., 1), 'random', or a range 'MIN-MAX' (e.g., '1-100').
# Default: 1
# PAGE=1

# --- Advanced Filtering ---

# MAX_FILE_SIZE: The maximum allowed file size for a wallpaper.
# This helps filter out very large images that may slow down your system.
# You can use formats like "500KB", "2MB", "1GB". Set to "0" to disable.
# Default: "2MB"
# MAX_FILE_SIZE="5MB"

# MIN_FILE_SIZE: The minimum allowed file size for a wallpaper.
# This helps filter out very small images that may be low quality.
# You can use formats like "100KB", "1MB". Set to "0" to disable.
# Default: "" (disabled)
# MIN_FILE_SIZE="500KB"

# MIN_SCORE: Only download images with a score greater than or equal to this value.
# Useful for filtering out low-quality or unpopular images.
# Example: MIN_SCORE="20"
# Default: "" (disabled)
# MIN_SCORE=""

# ARTIST: Filter posts by a specific artist or uploader's name.
# Example: ARTIST="k-eke"
# Default: "" (disabled)
# ARTIST=""

# POOL_ID: Download from a specific pool (collection) of posts instead of using tags.
# If this is set, the TAGS, RATING, and ORDER options are ignored.
# Example: POOL_ID="1234"
# Default: "" (disabled)
# POOL_ID=""


# --- Random Tag Feature ---

# This feature allows you to define a list of your favorite tags and have the
# script automatically pick a few at random to add to your search query.

# RANDOM_TAGS_LIST: A list of tags to choose from.
# Tags should be enclosed in quotes and separated by spaces.
# Example: RANDOM_TAGS_LIST=("landscape" "scenic" "sky" "clouds" "water")
RANDOM_TAGS_LIST=("landscape" "scenic" "sky" "clouds" "water" "original" "touhou" "building")


# --- Cache and Preloading ---

# PRELOAD_COUNT: The number of wallpapers to download in the background.
# While you are viewing the current wallpaper, the script will preload others
# to ensure a fast transition to the next one.
# Default: 3
# PRELOAD_COUNT=5

# MAX_PRELOAD_CACHE: The maximum number of wallpapers to keep in the preload cache.
# This prevents the cache from growing indefinitely.
# Default: 10
# MAX_PRELOAD_CACHE=20

# DISCOVER_LIMIT: The number of items to fetch for discovery modes (tags, artists, pools).
# Default: 20
# DISCOVER_LIMIT=50

# EXPORTED_TAGS_FILE: Path to file where discovered tags are exported.
# If this file exists, its contents will override RANDOM_TAGS_LIST for random tag selection.
# Default: $HOME/.config/konapaper/discovered_tags.txt
# EXPORTED_TAGS_FILE="$HOME/.config/konapaper/discovered_tags.txt"
